# Python Assignment 4 - Group: Plain Product.
### Analyzing dataset : Parkingspaces.

### Procedure to run the program:
* Clone the project into your computer.
* How to use the program:
  * In a command prompt or bash with Python available, use the following command together with the URL to the CSV file: 
  * python main.py http://wfs-kbhkort.kk.dk/k101/ows?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=k101:p_pladser&outputFormat=csv&SRSNAME=EPSG:4326

### Dependencies:
* Python - Anaconda Distribution 
* *In order to make sure that all librabies are present for a problem free execution of the software, we recommend using an Anaconda distribution of Python. But the software will probably also run with other distributiions, but then libraries such as Requests might need to be installed.*

### Using the program should result in the following output:

* **Console output:**

There are 12183 parking spaces in Indre By & the road with the most parkingspots is Elsdyrsgade

There is most parking spot in the even side with 60729 but there are more spots with marked parking in the uneven side with 23692


Watch the plots


* **The CSV file should be downloaded to the 'csv' folder.**

* **Plotting images should be created in .png format and found in the 'plots' folder as:** 

 

* **OBS:** *When creating the plot it should be displayed in a new window and the program execution will halt until this window is closed.*
